	\subsection{Accessing the Standard Library}
	To access the standard library, enter 'include(stdlib);' at the top of the source code. As noted earlier, including a file can only occur once, so do not include a class a second time. 
	
	\subsection{String}
	Dice provides certain standard library classes to assist the user with string manipulation and file I/O.

	\subsubsection{Fields}
	String has no public fields

	\subsubsection{Constructors}
	\paragraph{String(char[] a)}
	Accepts a char array, such as a string literal or a char array, and creates a String object

	\subsubsection{Methods}
	\paragraph{public bool contains(char[] chrs)}
	Returns true if and only if this string contains the specified sequence of char values.
	\paragraph{public int indexOf(int ch)}
	Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified character.
	\paragraph{public bool isEmpty()}
	Returns true if and only if length() is 0.
	\paragraph{public int length()}
	Returns the length of the string.
	\paragraph{public char[] toCharArray()}
	Returns the char array of this string.

	\subsection{File}
	The File class constructor takes one argument which is a char[] that points to a file on which the user wishes to operate. The constructor stores the given path in a field and then calls open() on the given path and, if successful, sets the objectâ€™s file descriptor field to the return of open(). If open() fails, the program exits with error.
	\subsubsection{Fields}
	File has no public fields

	\subsubsection{Constructors}
	\paragraph{File(char[] path, bool isWriteEnabled)}
	Accepts a char array to open a file on, then creates a file object with the file descriptor. isWriteEnabled is a parameter that is used to determine whether the file can be written to or just read from.

	\subsubsection{Methods}
	\paragraph{public char[] read(int num)}
	Reads num bytes from the open file and returns the bytes in a char array.
	\paragraph{public void close()}
	Closes the open file. On error, the program exits with error.
	\paragraph{public void write(char[] arr)}
	Writes the contents of the char[] array to the file
