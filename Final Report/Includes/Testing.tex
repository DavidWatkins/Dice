\begin{homeworkProblem}
	\chapter{Test Plan}
	\section{Testing Phases}
	\subsection{Unit Testing}
	We hand tested the scanner and parser to make sure it worked. We also printed out the AST and tokens using custom written code. 
	\subsection{Integration Testing}
	Discuss how we ensured the outputted code was correct and some of the thought that went behind different testers
	\section{Automation}
	Testing was very simple using ./tester.sh. We can verify that a test works individually by running lli on the outputted ll file
	\section{Test Suites}
	EDIT MEEEEEE
	There are two folders with our tests. should\_pass with test cases that should pass and should\_fail with
	test cases that should fail. Testing specific for components can be found in /src/backend/compile\_test/ for
	backend testing and /src/front\_end/regression\_test/ for frontend. These are manually run using the "main"
	binary produced by make.\\
	
	We tested the following features of our language. For example: Arrays, control flow, classes, inheritance, etc. Please list as many as possible.\\
	
	\section{Dice to LL IR}
	Please provide an example Dice program and the corresponding LLVM IR (DemoAnimals.dice?)
	
	\section{Testing Roles}
	Khal was the brains behind testing. Everyone contributed by making github issues
