Read the lessons learned from previous projects and prioritize (with your group) which of them you will implement. You will not be able to do them all, but if you can agree as a group on which mistakes you can avoid, you're already ahead. For our group, we determined that we will ACTUALLY start early, which we we did.

Fortunately, we had a very organized and decisive manager that made sure we were all on track throughout the semester. Make sure you nominate a person with same qualities if you don't want to spend the last week of the semester pulling all-nighters for this project (save that for your other exams).

Track tasks with Github's issue tracking. Keep this issue tracker open during meetings with the Professor/TAs in order to avoid forgetting discussed to-do items. Ensure the manager of the group delegates through this system.

To spare your team members pain, don't use the diff command's output in your test script. Just label the program's output and your expected output and place them on top of each other for easy reading.
