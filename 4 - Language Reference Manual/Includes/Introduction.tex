	\chapter{Introduction}
	JFlat is a general purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language. The principal is simplicity, pulling many themes of the language from Java. JFlat is a high level language utilizes LLVM IR to abstract away hardware implementation of code. Utilizing the LLVM as a backend allows for automatic garbage collection of variables as well. \\
	JFlat is a strongly typed programming language, meaning that at compile time the language will be type-checked, thus preventing runtime errors of type. \\
	This language reference manual is organized as follows:\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Chapter 2 Describes types, values, and variables, subdivided into primitive types and reference types
		\item Chapter 3 Describes the lexical structure of JFlat, based on Java. The language is written in the ASCII character set
		\item Chapter 4 Describes syntactic grammar for the language
		\item Chapter 5 Describes classes, how they are defined, fields of classes or their variables, and their methods
		\item Chapter 6 discusses the different library classes provided by the compiler and their definitions
	\end{itemize}
