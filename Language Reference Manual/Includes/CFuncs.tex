	\section{Functions Implemented in C}
    With LLVM IR dice is able to compile functions written in C to LLVM. The following functions for dice were written in C.
	
	\subsection{Declarations}
    \subsubsection{char* input()}
    The input function reads from stdin with the C standard library getchar() function, storing each character in a malloced char array, until a newline character is read. The resulting array is returned.
    \subsubsection{long* init_arr(int* dims, int dimc)}
